# Browser-Use TypeScript

This is a TypeScript port of the [browser-use](https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use) Python library, which provides a framework for building autonomous browser agents.

> **Note**: This is a best-effort port of the Python library and is not yet ready for production use. Credit for the original implementation goes to the creators of [browser-use](https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use).

## About

This TypeScript port was created as part of an initiative by [Vadavision](https://www.vadavision.com). The goal is to provide the same functionality as the original Python library in a TypeScript/JavaScript environment.

## Project Structure

The project follows a standard TypeScript project structure:

```
browser-use-ts/
├── dist/           # Compiled JavaScript files
├── src/            # TypeScript source files
│   ├── agent/      # Agent implementation
│   ├── controller/ # Browser controller
│   └── utils/      # Utility functions
├── examples/       # Example usage
├── package.json    # Project dependencies and scripts
├── tsconfig.json   # TypeScript configuration
└── README.md       # This file
```

## Features

- 🤖 Build autonomous browser agents using LLMs
- 🌐 Control web browsers programmatically
- 🔄 Execute complex workflows on websites
- 📊 Extract and process web data
- 🧩 Modular architecture for customization

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm (v7 or higher)

### Installation

# From GitHub
npm install github:vadavision/browser-use-ts
```

### Basic Usage

```typescript

async function runExample() {
  // Define the task for the agent
  const task = 'Visit example.com and extract the main heading';

  // Create a browser instance with configuration
  const browser = new Browser(new BrowserConfig({
    headless: false, // Set to true for production use
    disableSecurity: true // Useful for development
  }));

  // Create the agent with OpenAI integration
  const agent = new Agent(
    task,
    new ChatOpenAI({
      openAIApiKey: OPENAI_API_KEY,
      modelName: 'gpt-4o',
      temperature: 0.0,
    }),
  );

  // Run the agent
  await agent.run();
}

// Run the example
runExample().catch(console.error);
```
